				<h1>The 1st International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence Empowered Communication and Networking (AIECN 2024)</h1>
				<br>
				<h2>In conjunction with the 33rd International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN 2024)</h2>
				<h2>July 29-31, 2024</h2>

					<h2>THE WORKSHOP SCOPE</h2>
						<p>Emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) networking technologies potentially provide the promise of revolutionising the way we live, work, and manufacture, which includes Industry 4.0 and smart spaces (i.e., smart buildings, smart homes, etc） and automatic driving and smart city, etc. With the continued miniaturisation of smart devices and an exceptional amount of connectivity among smart devices, IoT networks will generate huge volumes of data to be analysed, transmitted, and processed, which will require higher reliability, lower latency, and scalability, which result in spectrum utilisation, resource allocation, and security perception in wireless access more sophisticated. Nonetheless, AI-enabled edge intelligence and space-air-terrestrial integrated network systems have been proposed to mitigate the heavy burden on the IoT network due to the centralised processing and storing of the massive IoT data. It is relatively novel to use AI-enabled radio and coexistence technologies to promise solutions to make the spectrum users have the ability to be self-adaptive, self-managed, and truly cognitive across all ranges of the spectrum among wireless communication systems, sensing systems, and future-generation systems in IoT. The aim of this workshop is to bring together and disseminate state-of-the-art research contributions that address various aspects of analysis, RF/antenna design, network performance optimisation, implementation, standardisation, and applications of AIenabled communication and networking. The topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
